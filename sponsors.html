		<h2 class="grid-100">Sponsor Roles</h2>
		<p class="grid-100">
		There are several different roles designed for nwHacks Sponsors. For different classifications of sponsors, there are opportunities for sponsors to interact with the attendees in varying forms and styles. The opportunities include: opening ceremony speeches; sharing expertise during workshops; hosting Tech-Talks; providing developmental support; joining the judging panel, and tabling
		</p>
		<h2 class="grid-100">Opening Ceremony</h2>
		<p class="grid-100">
		During the opening ceremonies, speakers will have the opportunity to provide an inspirational speech to participants whether it is a personal reflection on their own personal experience, or sharing an interesting project that they have been working on. The speeches do not have a set format, and is always open to innovative and creative ideas. The time allocated for the entire opening ceremonies is 2 hours which includes 15 minutes for welcoming and introduction speeches by the organizers, 15 minutes for an overview of the hackathon rules and regulations, a keynote presentation with the duration of 30 minutes, and three speakers’ presentations of 20 minutes each. The opening ceremonies will be hosted in a lecture hall, or auditorium where all participants are required to attend prior to the commencement of the event.
		</p>
		<h2 class="grid-100">Workshop/Tech-Talks</h2>
		<p class="grid-100">
		Qualified sponsors will have the opportunity to host workshops for industry experts to share their expertise, and allow participants to further develop their technical skills. Tech-talk opportunities are also available for industry experts to share their experiences and educate participants about the projects their company is currently pursuing or have completed. These workshops and tech-talks will be hosted at various classrooms and lecture rooms around the venue between the hours of 10 am and 9pm on Saturday of the weekend. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="grid-100">Sponsor Booths & Development Support</h2>
		<p class="grid-100">
			Development support for the participants will occur throughout the day on the Saturday of the weekend of the event. We encourage sponsors to ask their engineers and computer science experts to provide assistance during the event. 
Sponsor booths will be located around the venue for sponsors to have the opportunity to engage with the participants. The participants will have the chance to learn more about the sponsor companies and further develop their interest. We encourage sponsors to bring demos, gadgets and souvenirs to the event. Sponsor booths will be displayed during the evening hours on Friday during the registration period, all day on Saturday between the hours of 10am and 9pm and prior to closing ceremonies on Sunday during the judging panel. 
These two can be combined. For instance, the sponsors can provide development support at their corresponding booths. Having said that, sponsors are free to roam around the venue to provide any support that the students might need.

		</p>
		<h2 class="grid-100">Judging Panel</h2>
		<p class="grid-100">
		We would kindly like to invite you to be a judge for nwHacks, northwest region’s largest hackathon. We believe that your knowledge and expertise will be crucial in selecting the top awards of our event. The judging panel will occur on the Sunday of the weekend event, possibly between 11AM – 1PM. Though, we strong suggest judges to stay for the presentation, which occurs from 1PM – 3:30PM.
		</p>
		<h2 class="grid-100">Conclusion</h2>
		<p class="grid-100">
		Sponsors can take multiple roles; in fact, this is highly encouraged to maximize their interaction with students, and show their support for hackathons.
